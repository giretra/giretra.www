title: Coming from Belote?
description: Already know French Belote? Here's what's different in Giretra.
---

If you already play Belote, you're 80% of the way there. Giretra is a Malagasy descendant of Belote, so the DNA is the same: 32-card deck, 4 players in 2 teams, trick-taking, same card values. But the 20% that's different will trip you up if you don't know about it. Here's the short version.

## No turned-up card

In classic Belote, the dealer flips a card face-up after the initial deal, and players decide whether to "take" that suit as trump. If everyone passes, you go around again and pick a different suit.

Giretra throws that out entirely. There's no face-up card. Instead, the first player *must* announce a game mode, and negotiation goes from there. You're bidding blind based on what's in your hand.

## Three game modes, not one

Belote only has one mode: pick a trump suit and go.

Giretra has three categories with six total modes, ranked from lowest to highest:

- **Colour** (Clubs < Diamonds < Hearts < Spades) -- one suit is trump, like regular Belote
- **NoTrumps** -- no trump suit at all, every suit uses the non-trump ranking
- **AllTrumps** -- every suit uses the trump ranking (J and 9 are top dogs in all four suits)

This hierarchy drives the entire negotiation. You can only outbid with a higher-ranked mode.

## Negotiation replaces the simple auction

Belote's auction is straightforward: take or pass, maybe pick a different suit on the second round. Giretra's negotiation is a whole different beast.

The first player must announce a mode. After that, players can outbid with a higher mode, Accept the current bid, Double an opponent's bid (x2 stakes), or even Redouble (x4). Negotiation ends after 3 consecutive Accepts.

There are some twists that don't exist in Belote at all:

- **One Colour per team per deal.** If your teammate bids Colour Diamonds, you can't later bid Colour Hearts. The other team still can.
- **Auto-Double.** In NoTrumps and Colour Clubs, when an opponent Accepts your bid, it counts as a Double automatically. These modes are considered powerful enough that accepting is already a challenge.
- **Redouble restrictions.** You can only Redouble in AllTrumps and the higher Colour modes (Diamonds, Hearts, Spades). Not in NoTrumps or Clubs.

If you've played Belote Coinchee or Contree, the Double/Redouble concept will feel familiar. But the hierarchy of modes and the one-Colour-per-team rule are unique to Giretra.

## No declarations

This is probably the biggest surprise. Belote has a whole declaration system: belote-rebelote (20 points for K+Q of trump), sequences (20 to 100 points), squares/carres (100 to 200 points for four-of-a-kind).

Giretra has **none of that**. No belote-rebelote, no sequences, no carres. Points come exclusively from tricks and the last trick bonus. It makes the game cleaner and shifts the focus entirely to trick play and negotiation strategy.

## Scoring works differently

In Belote, you accumulate raw card points across deals, typically racing to 501 or 1000 points. Both teams can score their card points each round (as long as the taker makes their contract).

Giretra converts card points into **match points**, and how that conversion works depends on the mode:

| Mode | Total card points | To win | Match points |
|------|-------------------|--------|--------------|
| Colour | 162 | 82+ | **16** (winner takes all) |
| NoTrumps | 130 | 65+ | **52** (winner takes all) |
| AllTrumps | 258 | 129+ | **26** (split between teams) |

In Colour and NoTrumps, the winner takes everything. In AllTrumps, both teams score based on their share (card points divided by 10, rounded up), unless the announcer team falls below 129, in which case the opponents take all 26.

The match target is **150 match points**, not 501 or 1000.

## Sweeps hit harder

In Belote, a capot (winning all 8 tricks) gives you a bonus of about 90 extra points on top of the usual card points. Nice, but not game-ending.

In Giretra, sweeps are brutal:

| Mode | Sweep reward |
|------|-------------|
| AllTrumps | 35 match points |
| NoTrumps | 90 match points |
| Colour | **Instant match win** |

A Colour sweep ends the match right there, no matter the score. And sweep bonuses still get the Double/Redouble multiplier on top.

## The "both teams cross the finish line" rule

In some versions of Belote, if both teams hit the target score on the same hand, it's a draw.

Giretra handles it differently: if both teams cross 150 in the same deal, the target moves to 250. If both cross 250, it goes to 350, and so on. Somebody has to win cleanly.

## Quick cheat sheet

| | Belote | Giretra |
|---|--------|---------|
| Trump selection | Face-up card, take or pass | Blind negotiation, 6 modes |
| Game modes | Colour only | Colour, NoTrumps, AllTrumps |
| Declarations | Belote-rebelote, sequences, carres | None |
| Double/Redouble | No (only in Coinchee) | Yes, with restrictions |
| Scoring | Raw card points, race to 501/1000 | Match points, race to 150 |
| Capot/Sweep | ~90 bonus points | Up to instant match win |
| Card values | Same | Same |
| Card rankings | Same | Same |
| Deck shuffling | No | No |
| Last trick bonus | 10 points | 10 points |

The bones are the same. The strategy is different. If you're used to Belote, the lack of declarations will feel weird at first, but you'll appreciate how much more weight each trick carries. And the negotiation system adds a layer of bluffing and risk that the simple Belote auction doesn't have.
