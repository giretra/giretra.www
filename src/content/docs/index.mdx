<Accordion
  question="How many players do I need?"
  answer="Four players, split into two teams. Teammates sit across from each other. Play goes clockwise."
  type="basics"
/>
<Accordion
  question="What cards are used?"
  answer="A standard 32-card deck: four suits (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs), each with A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7. No cards below 7."
  type="basics"
/>
<Accordion
  question="Why is the deck never shuffled?"
  answer="That's a Giretra tradition. Before each deal, the player to the dealer's left cuts the deck instead. Split it into two halves and put the bottom on top."
  type="basics"
/>
<Accordion
  question="What's the winning score?"
  answer="First team to 150 match points wins. If both teams cross 150 in the same deal, the target moves to 250, then 350, and so on."
  type="basics"
/>

<Accordion
  question="Is there a face-up card like in Belote?"
  answer="No. Giretra has no face-up card. The first player must announce a game mode, and negotiation goes from there. You bid blind based on your hand."
  type="differences"
/>
<Accordion
  question="Are there declarations (belote-rebelote, sequences)?"
  answer="No. Giretra has zero declarations. No belote-rebelote, no sequences, no carres. Points come exclusively from tricks and the last trick bonus."
  type="differences"
/>
<Accordion
  question="What game modes exist?"
  answer="Six modes ranked low to high: Colour Clubs, Colour Diamonds, Colour Hearts, Colour Spades, NoTrumps, AllTrumps. You can only bid higher than the current bid."
  type="differences"
/>
<Accordion
  question="What happens with a sweep?"
  answer="In AllTrumps: 35 match points. In NoTrumps: 90 match points. In Colour: you win the entire match on the spot, regardless of score."
  type="differences"
/>

<Accordion
  question="Can I play online?"
  answer="Yes! Head to play.giretra.com to play with friends or practice solo."
  type="platform"
/>
<Accordion
  question="Can I build a bot?"
  answer="That's the plan. The SDK and bot-building documentation are coming soon. Check the Build Your Bot section for updates."
  type="platform"
/>
<Accordion
  question="Is Giretra open source?"
  answer="Fully open source. The game engine, the platform, and this documentation are all on GitHub. Contributions are welcome."
  type="platform"
